# Executive Summary
Revenue in 2020 peak at **$10.1M**, with the highest average order value being **$300**, making this Elist's strongest financial year. While 2021 recorded a higher order count of over **36k** orders, the lower AOV suggests a shift from high-value purchases to higher transaction volume rather than stronger customer spending.

Non-Loyalty members generated highest total sales at **$17.1M** compared to **$10.8M** for loyalty members, making them the primary driver for revenue. However, loyalty members outperformed non-loyalty members in 2021 and 2022, suggesting that while customer gain drives short-term sales, the loyalty program supports long-term retention.

The most popular product was the **_27in 4k Gaming Monitor_** achieving **$9.8M** in total sales, while the **_Macbook Air Laptop_** produced the highest average order value of **$1,588**. This indicates that Elist relies on both volume-driven products and high-value products, requiring different pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies across product categories.

Although the **_Macbook Air Laptop_** delivers the highest AOV, it also creates the greatest refund risk with an **18%** refund rate. Generally, laptops have the highest refund rate across multiple years, averaging around **17%** during peak periods. While refund rates in 2021 improved, laptops continue to show the highest refund rates and should be looked into further to better understand the cause.

North America produced the highest total sales of **$14.5M**, with its strongest performance year being 2020. This confirms North America as Elist's primary revenue engine and supports continued strategic investment in the region.

Overall, while Elist maintains strong revenue drivers across products and regions, improving customer retention and product return performance presents the greatest opportunity for long-term profits. The [recommendations](#Recommendations) below give a more in-depth outline for improvement.

In contrast, the MacBook Air Laptop and ThinkPad Laptop produced a highest overall AOV across all years of $1,588 and $1,100, respectively.

  Although the MacBook Air Laptop delivers the highest AOV, it also carries the highest refund rate among Apple products at 18%. Across all products, laptops consistently generate the highest refund rates, with the ThinkPad Laptop having 17% between 2019 and 2020. While refund performance improved across all products in 2021, laptops continued to have the highest refund concern. In addition, 2022 refund rates showed 0% across all products. This suggests a problem with the data that require further investigation.

  North America shows to be Elist's strongest market, generating $14.5M in total sales and peaking at $5.3M in 2020. In comparison, EMEA produced $8.2M, making North America the company's primary revenue-driving region. This confirms that continued investment into North America should remain a strategis priority while identifying opportunties for expansion in other regions.

## Product Health
  * Leadership should prioritize reviewing laptop return behavior and validating 2022 refund reportings to identify potential issues.
## Operational Efficiency 
  * Elist should maintain strong investment in North America while testing targeted growth strategies in other regions to reduce long-term single market dependancy.
