# Executive Summary
Revenue in 2020 peak at **$10.1M**, with the highest average order value being **$300**, making this Elist's strongest financial year. While 2021 recorded a higher order count of over **36k** orders, the lower AOV suggests a shift from high-value purchases to higher transaction volume rather than stronger customer spending.

Non-Loyalty members generated highest total sales at **$17.1M** compared to **$10.8M** for loyalty members, making them the primary driver for revenue. However, loyalty members outperformed non-loyalty members in 2021 and 2022, suggesting that while customer gain drives short-term sales, the loyalty program supports long-term retention.

The most popular product was the **_27in 4k Gaming Monitor_** achieving **$9.8M** in total sales, while the **_Macbook Air Laptop_** produced the highest average order value of **$1,588**. This indicates that Elist relies on both volume-driven products and high-value products, requiring different pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies across product categories.

Although the **_Macbook Air Laptop_** delivers the highest AOV, it also creates the greatest refund risk with an **18%** refund rate. Generally, laptops have the highest refund rate across multiple years, averaging around **17%** during peak periods. While refund rates in 2021 improved, laptops continue to show the highest refund rates and should be looked into further to better understand the cause.

North America produced the highest total sales of **$14.5M**, with its strongest performance year being 2020. This confirms North America as Elist's primary revenue engine and supports continued strategic investment in the region.

Overall, while Elist maintains strong revenue drivers across products and regions, improving customer retention and product return performance presents the greatest opportunity for long-term profits. The [recommendations](#Recommendations) below give a more in-depth outline for improvement.

  In 2019 and 2020 loyalty members seem to have underperformed generating less sales than non-loyalty members. However in recent years, the loyalty program seems to have increased purchases having more purchases than their counter part. This suggests that the loyalty program supports stronger long-term retention.

  While the MacBook Air Laptop delivers the highest AOV, it has the highest refund rate across all Apple products at 18%.

In 2021, all products improved their refund rate while the laptops continued to have the highest refund rates. An issue was found for 2022, showing all products generating a refund rate of 0%.
